# Face Recognition App

Even if the title is pretty explicit on its own, you deserve to know a little more about it.

I created it while following the corresponding course on Udemy: [The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/)


## What it does

The app has a logging platform (with a __PostgreSQL__ database). While you're connected, you can insert the link of a picture with someone's face on it. The API has a Face Recognition algorithm and return an area object, that allow me to draw lines arround faces from the uploaded picture.

## RESTful API

This project is my first RESTful API. I have used [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) as the API for this project.

## What tools I've used

The app bootstrapped with __create-react-app__ and It is hosted on __Heroku__. It has its own API (with a __PostgreSQL__ database) that allows me to connect the database and fetch user's profile (cf [faceRecognitionApp-api](https://github.com/BenjaminJaume/facerecognitionapp-api)).

## Conclusion

It is a complete __Full Stack Developer__ course. So I gained a lot of experience while coding and setting up the app.
